# 🕵️ Step 06: OSINT & Doxxing (How Identities Get Exposed)  

Goal: Understand how investigators, hackers, or adversaries stitch together crumbs of data to unmask someone — and how to avoid leaving crumbs in the first place.

## 🧸 Simple Analogy (5-Year-Old Mode)  

Imagine you’re trying to hide in a big forest.  
- You drop one sock → someone finds it.  
- You leave a wrapper → someone follows the trail.  
- You use your favorite whistle → they recognize the sound.  

Each crumb alone doesn’t prove it’s you. But when put together, the trail leads straight to your hiding spot.  

That’s what OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence) does.

## 🧑‍💻 Deep Dive: The Mechanics of Doxxing  

### 1. Username Reuse  
- Most people reuse handles across platforms.  
- Example: “coolguy123” on Reddit also exists on Instagram.  
- Cross-search engines (Namechk, Sherlock) instantly map these overlaps.  

### 2. Metadata in Media  
- Photos, PDFs, Word docs often contain:  
  - EXIF GPS (where the photo was taken).  
  - Camera model, serial number.  
  - Author name in Word properties.  
- One unstripped file can deanonymize you.  

### 3. Writing Style (Stylometry)  
- Your word choices, grammar, and typing rhythm form a fingerprint.  
- AI tools now link forum posts to authors with high accuracy.  
- Famous case: J.K. Rowling was unmasked as Robert Galbraith using stylometry.  

### 4. Social Graphs  
- Even if you hide your name, your **connections expose you**.  
- OSINT tools map friend/follower overlap across platforms.  
- Example: Anonymous Twitter account follows the same 30 people as your public one.  

### 5. Real-World Correlation  
- Posting “snowstorm here” narrows you to a city.  
- Sharing a photo of a meal reveals restaurant metadata.  
- Patterns of when you’re online reveal time zone + daily routine.

## 🛠 Step-by-Step: Avoiding OSINT Traps  

### 🔹 Step 1: Identity Compartmentalization  
- Never reuse usernames, emails, or photos across identities.  
- Generate random handles via password managers.  
- Separate devices/browsers for each identity.  

### 🔹 Step 2: Metadata Hygiene  
- Strip EXIF with tools (`metadata_cleaner.py` in this repo).  
- Convert documents to PDF print-to-file before sharing.  
- Use dedicated VMs for document handling.  

### 🔹 Step 3: Content Awareness  
- Never post details that can triangulate location.  
- Delay posts (don’t live-post from physical locations).  
- Avoid mentioning unique hobbies/interests that link back to you.  

### 🔹 Step 4: Social Graph Control  
- Don’t mix personal contacts with ghost contacts.  
- Use Session IDs (random IDs) instead of numbers.  
- Rotate friend circles across identities.  

### 🔹 Step 5: Writing Discipline  
- If highly targeted, change writing style.  
- Tools exist to “style-shift” writing.  
- Or keep ghost comms minimal, factual, and stripped of personality.

## ✅ Example Workflow  

1. Create anonymous Signal account (burner SIM).  
2. Never link with personal contacts.  
3. Only share photos scrubbed with `metadata_cleaner.py`.  
4. Use random usernames for backup accounts (not linked to old handles).  
5. Never post live from home/work — always with time delay.

## 🔒 Insight  

Most leaks aren’t technical — they’re **human discipline failures**.  
Encryption protects the message.  
Tor protects the route.  
Device hygiene protects the identity.  
But **OSINT slips** — a reused username, a photo with GPS — will undo everything.  

Ghost Protocol Step 06 ensures your **behavioral patterns** don’t betray your cryptography.  

👉 True anonymity isn’t just math. It’s consistency. One slip = game over.
